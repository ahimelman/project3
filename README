COS 318 Project 3: Pre-emptive Kernel

All of the required parts of project 3 are functioning.

We attempted the extra credit challenge to implement priority scheduling.
Instead of dequeuing the least-recently-added element in the FIFO ready
queue, we randomly dequeue an element with probabilistic weight equal to its
priority.  To do this, we first iterate through the queue and calculate
the total priority P; then we choose a random number between 0 and P-1; then 
we iterate through the queue again until the cumulative total priority is
greater than the random number we chose.

Priority scheduling works when we modify test_preempt to include priorities
in all configurations we could think of.

However, on rare occasions, priority scheduling causes test_all to crash.  We 
could not identify the source of the bug, since GDB apparently fixes the bug.

Priority scheduling is on by default.  To turn it off, edit the Makefile to
comment out the line:

CFLAGS += -DPRIORITY
